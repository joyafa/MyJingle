Features:
---------
- Add the Speex preprocessor functions (auto gaining, silence detection) to the G711 codec
- Support for other Jabber servers than Google Talk
- Complete and test the Speex codec implementation

Bugs:
-----
- If not correctly logged in you need to restart the programm, because the connect button won't work
- Implement winPing correct. This is possibly related to the following:
- If a direct connect is not possible and the P2P component of LibJingle is used, then the session setup takes longer than with Google Talk
- If an incomming call is cancelled the msgBox won't disappear.
