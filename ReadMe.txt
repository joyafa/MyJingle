This program is a Google Talk compatible client based on LibJingle.
It was created while adding VoIP to LLuna (http://www.lluna.de/).

MyJingle is released under the GPL. So please share your improvements. 

Thanks to my employer (http://www.bluehands.de) for releasing this software as OSS!

And of course many thanks to Google for their great work.

Have Fun....
