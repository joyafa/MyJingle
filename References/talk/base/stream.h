// StreamInterface is a generic asynchronous stream interface, supporting read,
// write, and close operations, and asynchronous signalling of state changes.
// The interface is designed with file, memory, and socket implementations in
// mind.

// The following enumerations are declared outside of the StreamInterface
// class for brevity in use.

// The SS_OPENING state indicates that the stream will signal open or closed
// in the future.
enum StreamState { SS_CLOSED, SS_OPENING, SS_OPEN };

// Stream read/write methods return this value to indicate various success
// and failure conditions described below.
enum StreamResult { SR_ERROR, SR_SUCCESS, SR_BLOCK, SR_EOS };

// StreamEvents are used to asynchronously signal state transitionss.  The flags
// may be combined.
//  SE_OPEN: The stream has transitioned to the SS_OPEN state
//  SE_CLOSE: The stream has transitioned to the SS_CLOSED state
//  SE_READ: Data is available, so Read is likely to not return SR_BLOCK
//  SE_WRITE: Data can be written, so Write is likely to not return SR_BLOCK

  // Read attempts to fill buffer of size buffer_len.  Write attempts to send
  // data_len bytes stored in data.  The variables read and write are set only
  // on SR_SUCCESS (see below).  Likewise, error is only set on SR_ERROR.
  // Read and Write return a value indicating:
  //  SR_ERROR: an error occurred, which is returned in a non-null error
  //    argument.  Interpretation of the error requires knowledge of the
  //    stream's concrete type, which limits its usefulness.
  //  SR_SUCCESS: some number of bytes were successfully written, which is
  //    returned in a non-null read/write argument.
  //  SR_BLOCK: the stream is in non-blocking mode, and the operation would
  //    block, or the stream is in SS_OPENING state.
  //  SR_EOS: the end-of-stream has been reached, or the stream is in the
  //    SS_CLOSED state.

  // data is written, or something other than SR_SUCCESS is returned.  Note that
  // unlike Write, the argument 'written' is always set, and may be non-zero
  // on results other than SR_SUCCESS.  The remaining arguments have the

  // Streams may signal one or more StreamEvents to indicate state changes.
  // The first argument identifies the stream on which the state change occured.
  // The second argument is a bit-wise combination of StreamEvents.
  // If SE_CLOSE is signalled, then the third argument is the associated error
  // code.  Otherwise, the value is undefined.

  // SS_OPENING and SR_BLOCK returned from stream member functions imply that
  // certain events will be raised in the future.
